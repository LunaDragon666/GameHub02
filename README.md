# GameHub
This "readme" will serve as type of reflection note, and as an instruction page to explain which functions the folder and link submissions have.

## 1.0. Overview
This is the first version of GameHub's repository for coding. The files and folders are organized with the thought of the website's most important pages from site architecture to GameHub from the subject Design 1. I have also added a folder called "pages" where all the rest of the linked (HTML-pages) are supposed to be further linked to and from the index page (homepage) to organize a majority of html files all in one place.

## 2.0. File structures and web folder

The main folder consists of four different folders (named CSS, images, js and pages), an index.html file and a readme-file. Here's a small introduction and comprehensive explanations to GameHub's repository files- and folder features:

**2.1. CSS and js**

There I've only prepared a CSS3 and JavaScript file for coding, so it's therefore empty at the moment, cause I've primarily focused more on creating a small trial version of index.html file to test both new and prior knowledge of HTML5 tags and coding. Not all possible combinations and functions of html tags have been tested, but other features and combinations will be tried out during the next topic.
