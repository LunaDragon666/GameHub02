<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Me: social creature, food-loving, almost always remember dreams, once secured an interview by writing a haiku. When I moved to New York at the end of February 2014, it was the first time I had ever visited the city, job prospects were <span>zero</span>, and I had no idea I'd be living on a pullout couch for the next four months.</p>
<p>Important to me: Family, friends, and a category I’ll just label “art” that includes new experiences, <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.vayamadrid.com/post/74045993877/a-few-words-from-our-new-editor-anna-cherry">education</a>, and a giving-and-receiving of expression. I want to become fluent in French and Spanish (which seems pretty reasonable given that so many people I’ve met from other countries are like, <span>“Oh yeah, I speak eight languages.”</span>), get a grasp of history, and become a good enough writer to move people who like words. Food, again, remains one of my greatest joys in this life.</p>

<p>I’m from a suburb of Little Rock, Arkansas called Conway.</p>

<h1>More About Me</h1>
<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
<p>Have I mentioned that I love eating? Eating alone, eating with friends, eating in exotic or mundane locales. So much eating, and I enjoy it all. Talking about weird things and ideas. Drink, dance, and travel. Also: movies, music, and reading. I do a lot of writing <span>or thinking about writing</span>, but “favorite” isn’t quite the right word—we’ve sort of got a love-hate-compulsion thing going. Same goes for exercise.</p>
<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
<p>Dream world, dream job (a hybrid): My "day job" is as a journalist, so I get paid to talk to new people and stay informed about what’s going on in the real world. In my free time, I’m an author, and I write about whatever strange subject matter I want because it’s not what pays the bills. (My professional reputation isn’t compromised at all—and is actually helped—by being <span>a little uncouth</span>, and I somehow have enough time to pursue both roles.) One of the things I write is scripts, with the occasional acting in my own or friends’ films. On the weekends, I go dancing and sing in small, dimly lit bars to people who aren't embarrassed for me at all. My piano repertoire has definitely expanded from fragmented YouTube tutorials and a few measures from a level-5 piano book song called "Romance" that I learned in about 1999. Actually, it’s looking like I may be...I’m...Miranda July?</p>
<h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
<p>Seven songs I’ve listened to a lot in the past week or so (because it’s my favorite number, and the number of days in a week):</p>
<ol class="list">
<li>Marvin Gaye-“Sexual Healing” (Kygo remix)</li>
<li>The Weeknd-“Dirty Diana” cover</li>
<li>BANKS-“Drowning”</li>
<li>Enrique Iglesias ft. Descemer Bueno, Gente De Zona-“Bailando”</li>
<li>FKA Twigs-“Papi Pacify”</li>
<li>Lowell-“I Love You Money”</li>
<li>Black Box-“Ride on Time” (This is more just my general getting-psyched-up anthem, listened to before going to the gym, out on the town, or into Google Hangouts for a business meeting. Cue <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcmvHkVYH0g">The Cutting Edge</a> workout montage.)</li>
